Coasters
Coasters are hand made using digital copies of my original art which is adhered to a 4” x 4” ceramic tile and covered with a two-part resin, creating a beautiful glossy finish.  Each coaster is padded to protect your furniture.  Coasters are priced at $7.00 each or four for $24.00.  You can mix and match the artwork.  

B’s Garden treasures can also make custom coasters using your photos or other high quality images which can be resized to 4” x 4”.  Contact us at info@BGTreasures.com for pricing.
