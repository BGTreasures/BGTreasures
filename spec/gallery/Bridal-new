If I had a single flower for every time I think about you, I could walk forever in my garden.  – Claudia Ghandi



Bridal Flowers

B’s Garden Treasures will preserve your floral memories. Flowers may be from a combination of the bridal bouquet, corsages, boutonnieres and/or flowers from the reception. The flowers will be carefully taken apart, pressed flat – using modern pressing techniques to remove the moisture –  preserved and creatively reconstructed and arranged into framed art which can be displayed in your home and cherished for years to come.  

They can be arranged like the original bouquet or creatively placed around a photograph, invitation, vows or other memento.  You will be involved in all design decisions and will have the opportunity to review and approve the design concept before it is finalized.  

Your special flowers will be vacuum sealed and professionally framed.  Acid-free products and UV-protective glass are used to ensure the lasting quality of your heirloom.


Full Bridal Bouquet 
Your entire bouquet will be pressed and preserved.  The groom’s boutonniere and select flowers from the ceremony and/or reception may be included in the design, if desired.  Final design may include mementos such as your vows, photo, bridal invitation, etc.  Unused flowers will be returned to the bride.  Choice of frames and matting.

Bridal Bouquet Recreation

11x14” Frame	$150 plus the cost of the flowers
Oval or square frames may be quoted upon request.


Keep the flowers as fresh as possible, until you can get them to B’s Garden Treasures.  Put them in a cool place, with their stems in water. Do not put water on the flower petals.  You can place the flowers in the refrigerator but DO NOT FREEZE!  For best results, get them to B’s Garden Treasures within 1-3 days. Please contact B’s Garden Treasures at info@BGTreasures.com BEFORE the wedding so your date will be reserved.  Otherwise, I may not be available to preserve your flowers. 

A non-refundable $100 deposit is required upon receipt of your flowers.  The remainder is due upon shipping or receipt.  

B’s Garden Treasures reserves the right to refuse flowers which are of poor quality.  You will be contacted within 2-4 weeks to discuss your design preferences. The order will be finished and ready for your enjoyment within 6-12 weeks.
