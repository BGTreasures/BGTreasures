How Long Will My Framed Flowers Last?

There are many determining factors, like the freshness of the flowers when received, and the conditions where the art is displayed.  B’s Garden Treasures makes every effort to ensure that your framed art will last a lifetime; however, because these are real flowers, changes in the color or fading are normal and should be expected over time.  Although you flowers are sealed and protected with UV Conservation glass, you should avoid displaying your finished piece in direct sun or UV light or in excessively humid conditions.
