Bridal Flowers
Flowers may be from a combination of the bridal bouquet, corsages, boutonniere and/or flowers from the reception. The flowers can be arranged like the original bouquet or creatively placed around a photograph, invitation, vows or other memento.  

B’s Garden treasures can also recreate your wedding flowers (when the original flowers are not available).   If you provide a list of the flowers and/or a photo of the bride’s bouquet, I can create a customized keepsake which would make a unique wedding or anniversary gift.

Please contact B’s Garden Treasures at info@BGTreasures.com BEFORE the wedding so your date will be reserved.  Otherwise, I may not be available to preserve your flowers.
