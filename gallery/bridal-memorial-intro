If I had a single flower for every time I think about you, I could walk forever in my garden.  – Claudia Ghandi

Bridal, Memorial and Special Occasion Flowers

B’s Garden Treasures will preserve your floral memories. Your bouquet or flower arrangement will be carefully taken apart, pressed flat – using modern pressing techniques to remove the moisture –  preserved and creatively reconstructed and arranged into framed art which can be displayed in your home and cherished for years to come.  You will be involved in all design decisions and will have the opportunity to review and approve the design concept before it is finalized.  

Your special flowers will be vacuum sealed and professionally framed.  Acid-free products and UV-protective glass are used to ensure the lasting quality of your heirloom.
