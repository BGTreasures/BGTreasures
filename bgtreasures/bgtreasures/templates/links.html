            <td>Desiccant Paper</td>
            <td>
              <p>This highly absorbant material works great for pressing flowers.  Create a sandwich of desiccant paper, viva paper towels, flowers and botanicals, viva paper towels and repeat. You can have several layers / sandwiches in a stack.  I use pieces of old paneling cut to size for the top and bottom of the stack to protect the desiccant paper.  Cover the stack with 1-2 patio bricks.  Change the desiccant paper every 1-2 days until the botanicals are completely dry.</p>
              <p>

            Desiccant paper can be recharged in the oven to remove the moisture.  I set my oven at the lowest heat (170 degrees) and recharge 10 sheets to a shelf for 20+ minutes. Then store the sheets in a mylar or plastic bag until needed. </p>

            <p>You can purchase desiccant paper from

            <td>
              <p>I use drytac brand laminate to protect the flowers on my greeting cards, journals and related products. It has tiny holes which are sealed by heat.  You can either use a warm iron with a piece of cloth between the iron and the surface of the card, or you can use a laminator. When using a laminator be sure to place the card in a carrier (such as a manilla folder cut to size).</p>
