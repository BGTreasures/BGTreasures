Care of Flowers
Keep the flowers as fresh as possible, until you can get them to B’s Garden Treasures.  Put them in a cool place, with their stems in water. Do not put water on the flower petals.  You can place the flowers in the refrigerator but DO NOT FREEZE!  For best results, get them to B’s Garden Treasures within 1-3 days.  

If you will be mailing your flowers to B’s Garden Treasures, please ship them “Overnight Express” and note the following:
•	Very carefully wrap the flowers in paper towels or tissue paper. 
•	Loosely pack your flowers into a box.  Add paper towels or tissue paper so the flowers are secure, and do not move around in the box when shaken.  Do not crush the flowers with the packing material.  You can ship the flowers in a Styrofoam cooler for best results or tuck a plastic “freezer pack” in the box.  
•	Label each item you are sending (e.g. bouquet, groom’s boutonniere, etc.) and include your contact information.
•	Contact B’s Garden Treasures to let us know that the flowers are coming.  
•	Do NOT request a signature when the flowers are delivered.
•	Include your $100 deposit with the flowers.  Once B’s Garden Treasures starts the pressing process, the deposit is not refundable.
